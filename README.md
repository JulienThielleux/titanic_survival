"# titanic_survival" 

This notebook was the first machine learning project I did.
It was part of a competition on the machine learning website Kaggle.

The goal of the competition was to develop a model that maximize the accuracy on the prediction of the fate of a Titanic passenger.
With an accuracy of 83.15%, this model would be in the top 3% of all the models that were submitted.
